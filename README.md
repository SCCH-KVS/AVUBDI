## Docker

## What is Docker Engine

Docker Engine is an open source containerization technology for building and containerizing your applications. Docker Engine acts as a client-server application with: A server with a long-running daemon process dockerd . APIs which specify interfaces that programs can use to talk to and instruct the Docker daemon.

[Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/)

## What is Docker Compose

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your application's services.

[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

### Installation of Docker Engine

#### CentOS

Install the yum-utils package (which provides the yum-config-manager utility) and set up the stable repository.

```shell
sudo yum install -y yum-utils
```

```shell
sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo
```

Install the latest version of Docker Engine and containerd.

```shell
sudo yum install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
```

Start Docker

```shell
sudo systemctl start docker
```

Install Docker Compose

```shell
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.26.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

Make Docker Compose Binary an Executable

```shell
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

Verify that Docker Engine and Docker Compose is installed correctly by running the cogniplant docker-compose.yml file.

```shell
sudo docker-compose up -d --build
```

The output should look like the following:

```txt
[mmayr@localhost Cogniplant]$ docker-compose up -d
